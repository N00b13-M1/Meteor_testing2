// title

// duration

// hasBeenWatched

// Using the  this  keyword, make sure the constructor assigns the received arguments to the corresponding fields in the new instance. Using the  new  keyword, create three instances of the  Episode  and store them in the variables:

// firstEpisode

// secondEpisode

// thirdEpisode

// Remember to pass appropriate arguments to each!
